```

## 📊 How It Works

### News Sources
The bot monitors RSS feeds from major sports outlets:
- ESPN (NBA, NFL, MLB)
- BBC Sport
- Reuters Sports
- CBS Sports
- Yahoo Sports

### Scoring System
Stories are scored based on multiple factors:

| Breaking News Keywords | 10 | "BREAKING", "JUST IN", "URGENT" |
| Major Events | 9 | "FIRED", "HIRED", "SUSPENDED", "ARRESTED" |
